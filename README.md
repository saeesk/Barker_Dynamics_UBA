# Barker's Dynamics
This is github repository for course MTH 598 taken by Saee Kamat in 2024-25

### Augmented Drift 
Contains codes and results for implementing augmented drift within UBA, i.e. AugUBA, in one dimension exponential distribution case, and Poisson Random Effects Model with exponential distribution as prior

### Poisson Random Effects 
Contains implementation of numerical experiment in the paper with logistic distribution and Gaussian distribution CDF asprobability function. 

### Thin_Tails_Posterior
Contains codes for implementing UBA and ULA for posteriors with tails thinner than Gaussian distribution, codes to generate other images in report
