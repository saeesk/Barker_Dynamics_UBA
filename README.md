##Augmented Drift - Codes and results for implementing the idea of augmented drift within UBA, in one dimension exponential distribution case, and Poisson Random Effects Model with exponential distribution as prior

##Poisson Random Effects - Implementation of numerical experiment in the paper with logistic distribution and Gaussian distribution CDF asprobability function. 

##Tin_Tails_Posterior-  Codes for implementing UBA and ULA for posteriors with tails thinner than Gaussian distribution, codes to generate other images in report
